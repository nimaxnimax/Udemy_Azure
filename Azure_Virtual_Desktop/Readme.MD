Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) is a comprehensive cloud-based desktop and application virtualization service provided by Microsoft. It enables users to access their desktops and applications securely from anywhere, using any device, thereby supporting remote work and business continuity. AVD simplifies the management of virtual desktop infrastructure by centralizing control through the Azure portal, and it integrates seamlessly with other Azure services for enhanced functionality. Key advantages include cost savings through pay-as-you-go pricing, scalability to meet fluctuating demands, and robust security features like multi-factor authentication and conditional access. AVD also supports Windows 10 and Windows 11 multi-session, providing a familiar desktop experience with the ability to run multiple concurrent user sessions. This makes AVD a versatile solution for organizations looking to provide flexible, secure, and efficient remote working environments.
