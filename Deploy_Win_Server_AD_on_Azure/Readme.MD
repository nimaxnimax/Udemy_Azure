Windows Server Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft that provides centralized domain management, including authentication, authorization, and directory services for Windows-based networks. Deploying Active Directory on Azure Cloud enables organizations to leverage the scalability, availability, and redundancy of Azure's global infrastructure, while integrating on-premises AD environments with cloud-based services. This hybrid approach enhances disaster recovery capabilities, ensures high availability, and facilitates seamless access to cloud resources, providing a flexible and secure environment for modern enterprise IT needs.
